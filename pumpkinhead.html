                    ritu: So when did you make pumpkin head? 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    julian: I made Pumpkinhead in high school in 2006. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    That's a long time ago. Do you remember what you were thinking when you made it? 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    It was, I was, you know, in high school I was always trying to get good grades and stuff and you know what, this might have been in middle school. This could have been like 2005. Anyway, I remember there was some assignment that I basically didn't do, so I'd always suggest extra, extra classes for extra credit or like extra projects for extra credit. And so I presented this project as extra credit cuz it was a class I needed to get a good grade in.

            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    What was the class 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    Maybe my mom remembers what class it was or like what, 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    I guess what class would you be doing this for? 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    I feel like it was for my home class. We had a class where we were writing. It was, you know, like writing and stuff. We were writing essays and stuff. It was for that class <laugh>. 
                    </div>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    But do you remember what the idea was? Or you just thought it would be funny to do it? 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    I remember I was interested in the visual of getting a pumpkin and putting it on your head. Like, it's like it's effortless and you know, when I was actually wearing the pumpkin head, it was not effortless and it stunk in there like a pumpkin, you know? And it's also like this idea that, you know, when you make a Jack O Lantern and you cut the stem off the top and I was thinking like, what if I cut the bottom out instead?

            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    Oh, that's cool. 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    So it’s a seamless pumpkin—
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    That's pretty interesting. 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    Head - laugh - and uh, you know, at the time I was a child and it was easy for me to do things that might seem embarrassing now. So I whipped it out, <laugh> and I had my mom's help. She helped me.

            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    She took all photos? 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    Yeah, she took all the photos. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    I really like this area you have with all the speakers 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    In high school, I had built a recording studio in my parents had a shop, close to our house. My parents built this structure and it was mostly for storage. It's supposed to be my dad's wood shop, but he kind of didn't use it. So eventually they let me build a kind of hangout area and recording studio inside the shop. So I had made a cool speaker stack, you know, I was obsessed with speakers. I had like, you know, 20 speakers or something, which I would hook up all to the same stereo, which is not what I was supposed to do to set speakers up, I would take all the wires and I'd twist them together and then put 'em all into one stereo. And what happens is the impedance goes down a lot cuz like it splits the electrical signal to each speaker. So each speaker was making just a little vibration. Like it wasn't very loud, you know, <laugh>. Anyways, this was, uh, almost like, uh, I just thought it looked cool.

            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    When you look at this stuff, like what it Remi, does it remind you of who you used to be? Or do you still feel a pumpkin head? 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    I still feel like I'm pumpkin head, but it was definitely a time of less direction and less inhibition. Also, I feel like at the time I was so bored, there was nothing to do and the only thing to do was pumpkin head. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    I love this series. I think it's such a cool vibe and you should do more of it. 
                </div>
                <div class="a">
                    I don't think I'm ever gonna do another pumpkin head series. This is a thing in the past, 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    But it's not pumpkin head. Exactly. But the vibe, the spirit of pumpkin head should live 
                    On the spirit of creation.                 </div>
                <div class="a">
                    Yeah. It's a feeling you have where you're just like, okay, we're gonna make stuff today, kind of like what we're doing right now. And it's just fun. And it's this feeling I get that it's like, you're like, okay, I want to go do laundry. And I'm like, no, no, no, please don't. 
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <div class="q">
                    I think it's like a way for you to embody who you want to be. It's like an exercise to, it's this experiment and then it's like you can perform.        </div>
                <div class="a">
                    Yeah. It's fun to make the thing. Yeah. And it's definitely a big experiment and if you're not so concerned with what happens at the end, it's freeing and you just go and have a good time. Mm-hmm. 
                     - affirmative~
                    In this case, I was just hanging out with my mom, so that was fun too .She took a lot of photos. Obviously these are the selects — I imagine. It was fun.                 </div>
